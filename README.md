## Description

"In fact, art always attempted to represent the greatest possible power, the power that ruled the world in its totality..."

― Boris Groys, Art Power

"In one of his treatises, Malevich writes about the difference between artists and physicians or engineers. If somebody becomes ill, they call a physician to regain their health. And if a machine is broken, an engineer is called to make it function again. But when it comes to artists, they are not interested in improvement and healing: the artist is interested in the image of illness and dysfunction. This does not mean that healing and repair are futile or should not be practiced. It only means that art has a different goal than social engineering. An illness does not allow a person to work, and a broken machine cannot function. In other words, both are failures from the standpoint of universal slavery. However, from the standpoint of art, both conditions manifest a sovereign rejection of this slavery. So, as Breton rightly says, here thought is at its freest and strongest."

― Boris Groys, The Museum as a Cradle of Revolution

"When Mussolini gives a speech in parliament, in 1925, taking full responsibility for the murderous chaos his regime has created, and challenging his opponents to remove him anyway, he is practicing decisionism at the expense of binary logic, which would dictate that if Mussolini is responsible, then he should resign. Instead, the dictator declares that he is responsible and that he will stay. Today it is our machines who make these speeches for us."

― Luciana Parisi, Reprogramming Decisionism

The ubiquitous cloud-shaped icon on the screen encapsulates an infinitely complex system of networks comprised of servers, routers, fiber-optic cables, data centers, and satellites, encircling the entire planet. This digital and physical infrastructure generates, aggregates, stores, transmits, and processes massive amounts of data, providing a "natural" environment for developing artificial intelligence systems at scale. Machine learning instruments that deploy in the cloud space enhance their capacities from available training datasets, becoming the engine of improvement in cloud-based technology's overall efficiency and effectiveness. The amalgamation of cloud computing with artificial intelligence is termed "the intelligent cloud" hegemonically controlled by a handful of leading technology corporations, is capable of inscription more and more aspects of the world into the computational body—based on the implicit assumption: the world is reducible to data that can be objectively analyzed and perfectly modeled.

The widespread adoption of an algorithmic way of seeing presents further expansions of the computational regime. To make interpretations about visual inputs, computer vision systems hunt down pixel patterns statistically similar to labeled data they have previously trained on. The Latin origin of the term data is the plural form of datum, meaning "(thing) given." Art, however, is never given as merely the thing. Only Cloud Knows, a Chrome extension that detects images containing "art", as perceived through the lens of Google Cloud Vision AI, manifests how this emerging paradigm captures the incalculable and unknown in computationally legible form—the confidence labels returned from Vision API overlay over images as Web page loads. By operating within the industrial CV model's wrong-headed perception, Only Cloud Knows invites users to inquire into the biases and limits of machine intelligence designed to see and foresee: what lies beneath its threshold of recognizability? What is excluded from future possibilities? With this project, I aim to mirror how belief in the technical sightline has clouded our vision and uncover how accelerating cognitive automation has short-circuited our sensory-noetic loop without detection.
