## Description

"In fact, art always attempted to represent the greatest possible power, the power that ruled the world in its totality..."

― Boris Groys, Art Power

"In one of his treatises, Malevich writes about the difference between artists and physicians or engineers. If somebody becomes ill, they call a physician to regain their health. And if a machine is broken, an engineer is called to make it function again. But when it comes to artists, they are not interested in improvement and healing: the artist is interested in the image of illness and dysfunction. This does not mean that healing and repair are futile or should not be practiced. It only means that art has a different goal than social engineering. An illness does not allow a person to work, and a broken machine cannot function. In other words, both are failures from the standpoint of universal slavery. However, from the standpoint of art, both conditions manifest a sovereign rejection of this slavery. So, as Breton rightly says, here thought is at its freest and strongest."

― Boris Groys, The Museum as a Cradle of Revolution

"One of the best ways to recognize new, effective political forms is that you don’t like them. They are paradoxical. They are disgusting. It doesn’t belong to the dark side, but it points to something that is already there."

— Akseli Virtanen

"When Mussolini gives a speech in parliament, in 1925, taking full responsibility for the murderous chaos his regime has created, and challenging his opponents to remove him anyway, he is practicing decisionism at the expense of binary logic, which would dictate that if Mussolini is responsible, then he should resign. Instead, the dictator declares that he is responsible and that he will stay. Today it is our machines who make these speeches for us."

― Luciana Parisi, Reprogramming Decisionism

The ubiquitous cloud-shaped icon on the screen encapsulates an infinitely complex system of networks comprised of servers, routers, fiber-optic cables, data centers, and satellites, encircling the entire planet. This digital and physical infrastructure generates, aggregates, stores, transmits, and processes massive amounts of data, providing a "natural" environment for developing artificial intelligence systems at scale. Machine learning instruments deployed to the cloud enhance their capacities via giant datasets, becoming the engine of improvement in cloud-based technology's overall efficiency and effectiveness. The amalgamation of cloud computing with artificial intelligence is termed "the intelligent cloud," hegemonically controlled by a handful of leading technology corporations, and capable of inscribing more and more aspects of the world into the computational body, based on one implicit assumption: that the world is reducible to data that can be objectively analyzed and perfectly modeled.

The Latin origin of the term data is the plural form of datum, meaning a "(thing) given." However, art and the variety of experiences it creates are never a given. _Only Cloud Knows_, a Chrome extension that performs art recognition to images, as perceived through the lens of Google Cloud Vision AI, manifests how this emerging regime attempts to capture the incalculable, incomparable, and unknown in computationally legible form—the confidence labels returned from the Vision API overlay the images as each page loads. By navigating within machine intelligence's wrong-headed perceptions, _Only Cloud Knows_ invites users to consider the limits of this data-centric worldview: What lies beneath its threshold of recognizability? What is excluded from future possibilities? With this project, I aim to mirror how faith in the technical sightline has clouded our vision and to uncover how accelerating cognitive automation has surreptitiously short-circuited our sensory-noetic loop.

智能设备界面上的云形图标封装了一个无限复杂的网络系统，由服务器、路由器、光纤电缆、数据中心和卫星组成，环绕着整个星球。 这些数字和物理的基础设施生成、聚合、存储、传输和处理海量数据，为大规模开发人工智能系统提供了“自然”的环境。部署到云端的机器学习工具集利用庞大的数据存储来训练和优化模型，成为提升云架构整体效率和效能的引擎。 云计算与人工智能的融合被称作“智能云”，由少数领先的科技巨头主导，能够将越来越多的存在物纳入计算体系，这基于一个隐含的假设： 世界可以简化为可供客观分析和完美建模的数据。

“数据”（data ）源自拉丁语datum 的复数形式，意为“给定的（事物）”。 然而，艺术及其创造的多样性体验从来都不是给定的。 软件艺术作品《只有云知道》是一个调用谷歌云视觉（Google Cloud Vision AI）对图像进行艺术识别的浏览器扩展程序。当软件运行时，从云视觉的应用程序接口（API）传送回的检测结果——配有置信度分数的标签——会随着网页加载叠加在被定义为艺术的图像上。与预先标记的数据样本中像素模式的关联性替代了主观的审美判断，以运算模型的准确率测度无法量化的艺术真实，《只有云知道》邀请使用者思考这种以数据为中心的世界观的局限性：什么被遗漏在可识别性的阈限之下？ 什么将被排除在算法调控的未来之外？ 通过这个项目，我旨在反映对技术视线的信奉如何蒙蔽了我们的视野，并揭示加速的认知自动化如何短路了我们的个体化回路。
